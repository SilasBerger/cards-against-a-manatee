# Cards Against a Manatee
Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals sometimes known as sea cows ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee)). _Cards Against a Manatee_ is a digital card game, which has absolutely nothing to do with said mammal. It's heavily inspired by (but not associated with) the similarly named game [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/). Credit for the core game idea and all the playing cards used in this project goes to Cards Against Humanity.

## Current Project State
This project is currently under construction. Release v0.1.0 marks the first playable prototype. However, most components will undergo signigicant changes before a version v1.0.0 will get released.
